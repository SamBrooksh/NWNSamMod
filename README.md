# NWNSamMod

This will require the moving of files to proper spot - the 2da files get put in a hak with nwhak, the tlk file gets put in tlk folder, the hak in the hak folder
And the mods into the module folder (and back to update it) - the module will need to have the erf imported into it

The hak and tlk go in Documents/NWN not the install path

On startup of the server - cmd needs to be run as admin
