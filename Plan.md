# Duelist

### Prerequisites
#### BAB 
+6
#### Skills
Tumble 5 ranks, Preform 5 Ranks
#### Feats
Dodge, Mobility, Weapon Finesse
### Class Skills
4 + INT
Tumble, Bluff, Listen, Spot, Search, Perform, Lore, Move Silently, Discipline

### Abilities
#### 1st Level
Precise Strike - While using a light 1 handed weapon and no shield, add duelist level to damage (Unless immune to crits) - looks like the easiest will probably the hacky way of on-hit scripts
Canny Defense - When wearing light or no armor, add INT to AC (up to max of Duelist Level)
#### 2nd Level
Expert Parry - Bonus to Parry at Level 2
#### 3rd Level
Enhanced Mobility - Gain bonus to AoO (check to see if possible - if not, may rework)
#### 4th Level
Grace - Gain +2 to Reflex
#### 5th Level
Riposte - Should make AoO after parrying... do more research into if this is possible or what
#### 6th Level
Acrobatic Charge - Bonus to Tumble? Should be bonus against difficult terrain so maybe get freedom?
#### 7th Level
Bonus To Parry and AC I think
Should be Elaborate Defense (which is sorta lame)
#### 8th Level

#### 9th Level
Deflect Arrows - Requires a light or one handed piercing weapon (Check to see if can add deflect arrows to be able to do that)
No Retreat - Maybe an Additional BAB increase? (Should be force enemies to provoke an attack... Seems doubtful to be able to occur)
#### 10th Level
Crippling Critical - Able to deal a penalty to target on crit (reduce speed to 10ft, 1d4 STR or DEX dmg, -4 to saving throws, -4 penalty to AC, or 2d6 bleed dmg - last 1 minute) - Probably should use some radial option to choose which one to be used in general. And then have it trigger in the onhit script as well


### Bonus Feats
8th Level only I think

### Stats
Gain Intelligence Every other level (I believe that I had been doing this with a feat - should be able just with a Table)
Improved Reaction - Gain +1 To dex every third level (can't do bonus to initiative)
